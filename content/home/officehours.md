Stop by anytime during my regular office hours (no appointment necessary). If you would like to meet with me outside of office hours, please use the link below to schedule an appointment. Time slots are by default 30 minutes long, but you can specify the meeting length in the appointment link if you would like to request a longer meeting.

<!-- Calendly link widget begin -->

<script src="https://assets.calendly.com/assets/external/widget.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
<a href="" onclick="Calendly.initPopupWidget({url: 'https://calendly.com/dariusli/mtg?hide_event_type_details=1'});return false;">Schedule a meeting with Mr. Li</a>
<!-- Calendly link widget end -->

If none of the time slots work for your schedule, please check with me before or after class to arrange for another time to meet. For all other non-scheduling issues and matters that cannot be addressed during office hours, please use the e-mail form below to contact me. Thank you for following these procedures.
